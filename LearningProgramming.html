            <h2>So you want to start Programming?</h2>
                        
            <p>
                Programming is a hot topic at the moment. The job market
                is currently flooded with companies looking for computer
                programmers but are unable to fill such roles due to a 
                lack of qualified candidates. Now is the perfect time for 
                anybody looking for a career change or anybody just 
                entering the job market to learn to code.
                <br><br>
                Let's just clear a few things up before we go any further. 
                Learning to code is not easy! If it was, everybody would 
                be doing it. However, it is not impossible either. You 
                need to put in time and effort in order to become a 
                computer programmer. Luckily, we live in the age of the 
                internet, which means that there are abundant resources 
                available to you, for free, at any time. To the left, there 
                is a list of such resources that I have found incredibly 
                helpful in my journey so far.

                        W3Schools is where a lot of people will start their coding
                        journey. W3Schools provides users with tutorials and 
                        references on different programming languages such as HTML, 
                        CSS and JavaScript, to name a few. W3Schools reduces the 
                        confusion that often arises with coding by making their 
                        content simple and easy to understand. The tutorials and 
                        practise exercises have helped me a lot in understanding how 
                        CSS and Javascript work. W3Schools is also a great references
                        point for users and I have found myself checking W3Schools an
                        awful lot over the last few months just to refresh my mind on 
                        how certain bits of code work together.

                        When learning to code for the first time, there will undoubtedly 
                        be mistakes. Those mistakes can be obvious and make your code 
                        unreadable for the web browser or it can be a subtle mistake that, 
                        although still readable, makes things harder for the browser to 
                        read, small mistakes in the code that the browser will ignore or 
                        your code does not follow formatting rules. This is why it is 
                        important to use a validator tool. I have often used W3C HTML 
                        validator to check that my code is correct and readable by the web 
                        browser. W3C HTML validator will ensure that any website you 
                        create is technically sound and will not cause any unexpected 
                        problems further down the line. You will see at the bottom of all 
                        pages on my websites that there are links to the validators.

                        As mentioned above, it is vitally important to check that your 
                        code follows strict formatting rules. This is not just in 
                        regards to HTML. The W3C CSS validator will ensure all your CSS 
                        styling code will follow the correct formatting rules and that 
                        there are no errors in your code. Once the code has been 
                        validated you can be confident in the technical quality of your 
                        code. Again you will see a link to the CSS validator at the 
                        bottom of the page of all the pages of my website.

                        One of the most frustrating things any coder will experience 
                        is not being able to get your code to work. You've checked it 
                        your code numerous times and can't for the life of you see 
                        the problem. This is where the debugger feature comes in to 
                        play. Learning how to use the debugger has saved me so many 
                        hours of frustration in the last few months so I feel it is 
                        vitally important that you learn how to use this effectively 
                        early on. Please read the

                        There are many websites available that can teach you how to
                        code but I have found codecademy.com the most useful so far.                            
                        Codecademy breaks down each element of the language and makes
                        it easy for users to understand. The courses on codecademy 
                        are very easy to follow, full of useful tips and helps 
                        reinforce what you are learning with the use of interactive 
                        quizzes and little projects. There are activities to 
                        complete as well as detailed videos narrated by experts that 
                        go through every detail of projects so you can really 
                        understand what is being taught. The instructions are                             
                        incredibly simple to follow and courses can be done at your 
                        own pace. Often the courses or projects will go over things 
                        used in previous projects or courses to reinforce the 
                        knowledge you gained earlier.
