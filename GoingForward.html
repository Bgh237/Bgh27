            <p class="body1">
                My main objective when it comes to JavaScript is to complete the 
                course. We are currently about half way through the course and 
                everything has gone well. We only have a few more subjects to 
                cover and then it will be time for the final exam. Everything so 
                far has been good, I have enjoyed learning JavaScript as it 
                provides a bit more of a challenege than HTML and CSS. I find it 
                more technical than design based and as I am a more technical 
                person it suits me a lot better. My aim is to do as well as I 
                possibly can in the final exam and get the best grade I possibly 
                can on the course.

            <p class="body2">
                I have noticed from my studies that I am nowhere near a full 
                understanding of the language. I feel I have done well in the 
                tasks set in class and although I have been challeneged with 
                certain aspects of the tougher challeneges I have always managed 
                to get them done. However, I have noticed that when checking 
                websites such as stack overflow for help, people are providing 
                code which I do not understand. I would like to be in a position 
                at the end of my studies to full understand the code they are 
                offering as I find it frustrating not understanding aspects of a 
                subject I am learning. Whether we will cover these in the next 
                months on the course I do not know but I would like to understand 
                it anyway.

            <p class="body3">
                The JavaScript course is the first part of the software 
                Development route available to us as students in Haaga-Helia. 
                This is part of the Orientation to Software Engineering course
                will progress on to learning other languages and skills such as
                Java and Database programming. I fully intend to do all of these 
                lessons in order to get a broad knowledge of software Development
                and hopefully enhance my employment credentials. JavaScript is a
                great starting point and has really sparked a desire in me to keep 
                on learning different things in coding.
