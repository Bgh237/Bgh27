            <h2>Job Hunt</h2>
        
            <p>
                This may be a little premature as I am still in my first 
                semester studying at Haaga-Helia but at some point in the 
                next few years I will need to start looking for a job within 
                the ICT field. I have decided to create a table to show what 
                jobs are currently available, what skills they are looking 
                for and any other information that may be listed on the job 
                advertisment. A lot of these jobs are going to be unsuitable 
                for me due to my experience and skill levels but it is always 
                good to know where you need to be in order to achieve your 
                goals. These jobs have been taken from a number of different 
                websites and have been advertised within the last few months 
                so all skills are skills currently needed in the job market 
                here in Helsinki.
