                    <P>
                        Hi, my name is Simon and this is my website for my Digital Services
                        class at Haaga-Helia UAS. I have been studying HTML and CSS for 4 
                        months now and have combined all the skills I have learnt to create 
                        this responsive website. 
                        <br><br>
                        I have focused on creating content that will help users to learn the
                        basics of HTML and CSS and some of the fundamentals needed to learn
                        a programming language in general. 
                        <br><br>
                        I hope you find this website enjoyable and learn something new along
                        the way.
                    </P>

                <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted 
                    programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
                    It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, 
                    prototype-based and multi-paradigm. 
                    <br><br>        
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core
                    technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive 
                    web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast 
                    majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a 
                    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
                    <br><br>        
                    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, 
                    functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-
                    based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, 
                    dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does 
                    not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics 
                    facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it 
                    is embedded.
                    <br><br>        
                    Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript 
                    engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, 
                    including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web 
                    programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime 
                    environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and 
                    desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
                    <br><br>        
                    The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not 
                    extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written 
                    in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
                    <br><br>        
                    Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including 
                    language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two 
                    languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript was 
                    influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.
