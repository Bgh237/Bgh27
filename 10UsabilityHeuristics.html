            <h2>What are the 10 Usability Heuristics</h2>

            <p>
                The 10 Usability Heuristics are a commonly used Heuristic 
                evaluation method, created by Jakob Nielsen, which is used 
                to evaluate the usability of a website or software from the 
                users perspective. By following these rules you can ensure 
                that your website is user friendly and will encourage users 
                to come back and use the website again and again. Not all of 
                the 10 Usability Heuristics are applicable to every website 
                but it is important to ensure that if one of the steps is 
                applicable to your website that you ensure that you have 
                followed the rules. Below I have listed the 10 Usability 
                Heuristics and have described either how I have followed this 
                step or how it is not applicable to my website. Please read 
                below. 
            </p>

        </section>

        <section class="mainContent">

            <h3>1. Visibility of System Status</h3>

            <p class="def">
                The system should always keep users informed about what is 
                going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                This is not massively applicable to my page as nothing is 
                being loaded or retirieved on the page, however I have made 
                sure that the page you are on is highlighted on the 
                navigation tab so that users know exactly what page they are 
                on when they are using the system.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Match Between System and Real World</h3>

            <p class="def">
                The system should speak the users' language, with words, 
                phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than 
                system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, 
                making information appear in a natural and logical order.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                As you can see from reading my website, the language used is 
                all plain English. There is no extreme technical jargon that 
                will not be understood by the user. Any technical language 
                used for educational purposes but I have explained everything 
                as simply as I can so that users understand the content of 
                the website.
            </p>

            <h3>3. User Control and Freedom</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Users often choose system functions by mistake and will 
                need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the 
                unwanted state without having to go through an extended 
                dialogue. Support undo and redo.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                The website is very simple so there are very few chances for 
                users to get lost or make a mistake when navigating the 
                website. If users do navigate on to the wrong page they can 
                simply scroll up to the navigation bar and select the right 
                page. The navigation links clearly explain what the page will 
                show so there should be no confussion there.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Consistency and Standards</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Users should not have to wonder whether different words, 
                situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow 
                platform conventions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                As you can see from this page, and every other page you have 
                visited on my website, each page uses the same picture and 
                style of navigation bar. There is some slight difference in 
                the layout of the main content of the page but everything 
                else is standardised so no to confuse users. 
            </p>

            <h3>5. Error Prevention</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Even better than good error messages is a careful design 
                which prevents a problem from occurring in the first 
                place.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                This is not really applicable to my website as the website 
                is very simple and there are few chances to make errors. 
                However, as menthioned before my navigation bar is very clear 
                so users know what each page will be talking about so that 
                should prevent users from clicking on the wrong link. I have 
                also ensured that the link you are hovering over lights up so 
                you know exctly which link you click on.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Recognition Rather than Recall</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Make objects, actions, and options visible. The user 
                should not have to remember information from one part of 
                the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the 
                system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever 
                appropriate.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                My website is very simple so users should be able to 
                understand and see what each element on the page does. It is 
                basically an information page and the information is clearly 
                displayed on both mobile and desktop. The navigation bar is 
                clearly displayed too so users know how to navigate the 
                website.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed 
                up the interaction for the expert user such that the system 
                can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow 
                users to tailor frequent actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                This is not applicable to my website as there is no need for 
                accelerators as the site is so simple. The layout is 
                efficient as possible without adding a page navigation bar 
                at the top, as well as a site navigation bar.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant
                or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a 
                dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and 
                diminishes their relative visibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                I have tried to keep the design as clean and minimalistic as 
                possible. The page is not cluttered and the design flows well 
                from header, navigation on to the information in the text. 
                The designs slightly differ from mobile to desktop but both 
                are clean and easy to use/understand.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Help Users Recognise, diagnose and Recover from Erros</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no 
                codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively 
                suggest a solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                This is not applicable to my website as no error messages 
                or codes show up at all.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Help and Documentation</h3>

            <p class="def">
                Even though it is better if the system can be used without 
                documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and 
                documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, 
                focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried 
                out, and not be too large.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                Again this is not applicable as there is no need for help or 
                documentation with this website.
            </p>
