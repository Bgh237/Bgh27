            <h2>My Eureka Moment</h2>

            <p>
                In my expereinces with Javascript it is generally quite an 
                easy programming language to learn. However, I did face an 
                issue when I was learning the arrays. The problem I was having 
                was that I was over complicating things in my head and thinking 
                things were much harder than they acually were. I used a number 
                of sources on the internet to try and figure out the issues I 
                was having with Arrays but all I seemed to come across was 
                solutions for more difficult and adanced options. I kept working 
                at my problems and then everything seemed to click in to place 
                and I started to look at things in a more simplistic way. By 
                doing this I overcame my issues and started to understand arrays 
                better. I am now comfortable with the arrays and no longer have 
                a problem. Below I have listed a number of features of Javascript 
                that you are likely to come across whilst learning. I have 
                explained how each works so hopefully after reading this you will 
                better understand Javascript as a whole.

            <h2>Functions</h2>

            <p>
                Functions are a key component for Javascript. Functions allow a 
                set of instructions or statements to be carried out which 
                calculates to a value. The function needs to be called from your
                HTML code and the HTML page needs to be linked to a JavaScript
                page. Below is a simple example of a function as show in HTML 
                and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <div class="picContainer">
                <figure>

                        Example of a simple JavaScript function

                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images/Function_example_2.png" alt="Functions Example">
                    <figcaption>
                        Example of a simple JavaScript function
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images/Function_example_3.png" alt="Functions Example">

                        Example of a simple JavaScript function
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>
                As you can see from the picture, the HTML page is linked to 
                the js page via the script tag. The function is then created 
                in js. When the function is called at the bottom of the js 
                page, it follows the set of statements defined by the function,
                using the input within the brackets as the input in to the 
                function. In the first function, the price is defined as 
                100.00 so the variable priceWithVat becomes 100.00 * 1.24. An
                input text is created using the information and the the output
                text is printed to the console with the use of console.log.
                The output can be seen in the bottom box on the left.

            <h2>Variables</h2>

            <p>
                Variables are an important part to learn in JavaScript. 
                Variables allow you to assign string or integers to a word.
                They are basically a named memory location. This becomes very 
                handy when using very large numbers or calculations. Instead 
                of typing out the whole number or calculation, you can just 
                type the name of the variable and JavaScript will know you 
                want to use whatever has been assigned to that variable. This 
                will speed up your code writing a great deal and makes your 
                code a lot easier to read for other developers and web 
                browsers. Below is an example of variables in use:
            </p>

            <div>

            <figure>
                <img class="pic1" src="Images/JS_variables_example.jpg" alt="Variables Example">
                <figcaption>
                    Example of a simple JavaScript variable
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            </div>

            <p>
                As you can see from the picture, var x is created and the 
                number 5 is assigned to the variable x. Next the variable y is
                created and the number 6 is assigned to the variable y. 
                Finally, the variable z is created and the variable x is added
                to the variable y. As x is 5 and y is 6, z becomes 5 + 6 which
                equals 11. If you were to print z it would print the number 11.
            </p>

            <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>

            <p>
                Conditional statements are used to execute or skip a statement 
                that meet or do not meet a specified condition. This is done with
                the use of 'if' and 'else' statements. If the input matches a 
                certain criteria, a certain code will run, else another code will
                run. This is shown in the example below:
            </p>
        
            <div class="picContainer">

            <figure>

            <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    Example of a simple JavaScript conditional statement
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>  

            <p>
                As you can see, a form has been created using the &lt;form&gt; 
                tag. This creates a text box and assigns an id to the input of 
                the text box and calls the function when the OK button is clciked.
                In our js page we can now define the function. We retrieve the 
                input to the text box by using the document.getElementById().value 
                code. This finds the id that you specify and returns the value of 
                the id. It has then been assigned to the variable ageText
            (   This is currently saved as text ad not a number). Next it is 
                converted from a string to an integer and saved to the variable 
                age. We then use the if statement to see if the input matches 
                certain criteria. In this case, whether the person is an adult or 
                a minor. The if statement will take the input and IF it is less 
                than 18 then the code will run to assign the output text to 
                "You're a minor", ELSE it will run the code to assign the output 
                text to "You're an adult.". It will then print the results to the 
                page using the document.getElementById().innerHTML code. Notice 
                the .innerHTML part of the code will input what you assign to 
                that code to the page, whereas the .value will retrieve the value
                from the id. This was something that I realised early on was 
                important as it made it much easier for me to understand how id's 
                work.

            <h2>Loops</h2>

            <p>
                Loops are an important feature within JavaScript. There are two 
                main types of loops, a 'for' loop and a 'while' loop. Both of 
                these loops will run a code when certain criteria is met. If the 
                input does not meet the criteria, the code will not run. Below is 
                an example of a 'for' loop and a 'while' loop:
            </p>

            <h3>While Loop:</h3>

            <div class="picContainer">

                        Output of 'while' loop code
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

            </div>

            <p>
                From the example of the 'while' loop we can see that the variable 
                i is defined outside of the loop as well as the variable text, 
                which has been left as an empty string. i has been defined as 0 
                so when we start the loop we know that i is 0. The loop specifies 
                that while i is less than 10 this code will run. As we know, i is 
                0 to start with so we enter the loop. The loop then tells us that 
                we need to add the string to the text variable. Notice the += 
                sign here. This is very important to remember as this allows you 
                to add something on to an existing variable. Remembering this will 
                help a lot when you are asked to code more complicated things. 
                After the string is added we also add the value of i to the 
                string, which is this case is 0. Adding something to a string 
                like this is known as concatenation. The text is then saved to 
                the variable for future use in the loop. We then see i++ in the 
                code. This is a simpler way to say i + 1 and turns i from 0 to 1. 
                We then go back to the while condition and check that i still 
                meets the condition, which it does, so we run the code again. 
                This will continue until i no longer meets the condition outlined 
                by the loop. Once this heppens we then print the combined text to 
                the HTML page and out output can be seen in the picture on the 
                right.
            </p>

            <h3>For Loop:</h3>

                        Example of a simple JavaScript 'for' loop code

                <figure>

            </div>

            <p>
                As you can see from the example of the 'for' loop, it is very 
                similar to the 'while' loop. The major difference is that the 
                variable i is defined within the parenthesis of the 'for' loop 
                rather than outside it like with the 'while' loop. You will 
                notice that the i++ is also within the parenthesis but everything 
                else is very much the same. The text variable is defined outside 
                the loop and added to within the loop like before. The 'for' loop 
                makes your code look much cleaner and then things get more 
                complicated it is generally easier to understand than a while 
                loop. However, there are some confusing aspects to the 'for' loop 
                that confused me at first. As we have mentioned there are 3 parts 
                to the 'for' loop, the allocation of a number to the variable, 
                the condition and the addition/subtraction of i. Although these 
                are all in the parenthesis, the loop does not action all of these 
                before entering the loop. First it will take the assigned value 
                of the variable and check it against the condition. If the 
                variable meets the condition specifications then it will enter 
                the loop. Once it enters the loop it will action the code within 
                the loop. It will then go to the addition/subtraction and in this 
                case add 1 to the variable i. It will then check this against the 
                condition and enter the loop again. It will continue to do this 
                until the variable i no longer meeters the specifications of the 
                condition and once that heppens it will leave the loop and print 
                the text variable to the HTML page as with the 'while' loop.
                <br><br>
                Loops are something that I defintely struggled with but I think
                my major problem with it was over complicating it in my mind. It
                is important to remember that the variable i is used only to 
                specify how many times the loop will run and has no impact on 
                anything else outside of the loop. One piece of advice I would
                give to you is that if you are struggling with loops, try to
                uncomplicate your thoughts and keep it simple. This helped me a
                lot when first learning loops.

            <h2>Arrays</h2>

            <p>
                Arrays are very useful within JavaScript. Arrays allow you to 
                store multiple values in a single variable. This may not sound 
                that useful but if, for example, you had 100 students and you 
                wanted to print all of their grades to the console, without an 
                array you would have to type out each grade and assign each grade 
                to its own variable. This would be very time consuming and clog 
                up your page. Arrays allow you to create one variable and recall 
                any value within the array by typing the name of the array and 
                the position of the value within the array. The position needs to 
                be within square brackets, for example, array[1]. It is very 
                important to know that within an array the first value will be at 
                position 0 and not 1. This caused me a little bit of confusion at 
                first but the more you practice with arrays this will become 
                second nature to you. New values can be added to an array at any 
                time and values can also be replaced within an array so once you 
                have created an array they are very flexible. Below is an example 
                of an Array within a loop:
            </p>

            <div class="picContainer">

                        Array within a loop code

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

            </div>

            <p>
                As you can see from the example, an array has been created for 
                different types of fruit. the fruits.length feature returns the 
                length of the array so in this case it would return 4 as there 
                are 4 values in the array. This can cause some confusion as we 
                said earlier that the array starts from position 0, however when 
                it comes to length we simply count how many values are in the 
                array and ignore any postions. When we enter the loop we have 
                specified that i is 0 and that the amount of times we go through 
                the loop will be less than the length of the array. We now enter 
                the loop and add to the text variable as we have met the 
                conditions of the loop. You will see that fruits[i] is added to 
                the text variable. This is taking the value of the fruits array 
                that matches the postion i, which in this case would be 0 so we 
                take the value that is in position 0 of the array. This is then 
                added to the text and we continue with the loop. As we have added 
                1 to the variable i that now become 1, which meets the condition 
                so we go in to the loop and now we added the value that is in the 
                furits array at position 1 as i is now 1. This continues until 
                the condition is no longer met and we come out of the loop and 
                print the text variable to the HTML page. Please note that when 
                using an array within a loop it is important to set the condition 
                of the loop to less than the length of the array. This is useful 
                becomes often things will be added to the array so the size will 
                grow. If we set the condition to a specific figure, the array 
                could quickly outgrow that number and our loop is no longer 
                effective. It is also important to set it less than the length 
                due to the postions of the values in the array. As mentioned 
                earlier if an array has 4 values its positions will be 0, 1, 2, 3 
                so i can only go up to 3 to bring back a value. If we set the 
                condtion to less than or equal the length we would get i is 4 and 
                as there is nothing in position 4 this will return nothing. This 
                is something that I had to get my head around as it seems quite 
                contradictory but the more you do it the more it sticks with you.
